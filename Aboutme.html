    <P>I'm from Karimnagar, India. I completed my bachelors in Computer Science and
        I have work experience as a Senior Software Engineer at Dell Technologies.
        I'm here to pursue my masters in applied computer science and I'm very interested in Coding and application
        development,
        problem solving and Cloud Technologies. I'm really looking forward to learn, understand the depth knowledge.
        I want to grow as a Solution Architect going further by enhancing my knowledge and skills in various
        technologies.

    <h3>WALL-E</h3>
    <p>WALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot left on Earth. He spends his days
        tidying up the planet
        , one piece of garbage at a time. But during 700 years, WALL-E has developed a personality, and he's more than a
        little lonely.
        Then he spots EVE (Elissa Knight), a sleek and shapely probe sent back to Earth on a scanning mission. Smitten
        WALL-E embarks on his greatest adventure yet when he follows EVE across the galaxy.
